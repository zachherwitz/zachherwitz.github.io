When I pass a string of characters in to the input, i can do something to each one


I would want to store a flashcard object maybe for each one, and have an array of objects.

Maybe make a class

Each object would have the following properties




let flashCardArray = []

class FlashCardSet {
  constructor(targetPronunciation, targetChar) {
    this.targetPronunciation = targetPronunciation;
    this.targetChar = targetChar;
  }



}



constructFlashCardDeck = (pinyin, pronunciation) => {



}


let $newFlashCardSet = new FlashCardSet (charPinyin, charPronunciation)
flashCardArray.push($newFlashCardSet);
