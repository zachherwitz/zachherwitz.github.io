Chinese Text Lookup:
https://ctext.org/plugins/apilist/



User Story:

Depending on which section of the page the user is on, they will have the below experience:

The user will be able to input a Chinese character and receive back information including related characters, stroke number, its root radical, and several sample sentences to translate on their own.

The user will be presented with a series of flashcards which asks them to match the pinyin spelling with the image of a character.

The user will have to order the dynasties sequentially using css drag and drop properties in order to win. Information will appear in a side section based on which dynasty is hovered over

NEW PATH FOR THE APP:

How can I make this programatic, so I can sort of just drag and drop apps into the window 'app container' sockets?
