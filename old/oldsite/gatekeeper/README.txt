GATEKEEPER

Play as the assistant to a busy executive. 

Every morning, you recieve a list of important appointments, people, and events that your boss expects you to gatekeep. 
However, you are perpetually unable to read your boss's handwriting, and too anxious to ask for clarification. 

Based on this information and your best guess, you need to determine whether each caller or visitor should be passed along to your boss.
While making this decision, your Anxiety Meter increases. Your Anxiety Bar begins to decrease once a decision has been made.
Incorrect choices lower your Job Performance Meter.

Each day, there are a number of 'blacklist' and 'VIP' callers or visitors.

If a caller or visitor is left waiting for too long, they will hang up or leave the office. 
A visitor/caller leaving lowers your Job Performence Meter and raises your Anxiety Meter.

You are instantly fired if your Job Performance Meter reaches 0
You are instantly fired if your Anxiety Meter reaches 100
You are instantly fired if you allow through an Instant Loss
You are instantly fired if you allow a VIP to leave

At the end of the day, you are fired. No matter what.

Good Luck!
